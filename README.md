This is a program that tries to model Martian sun path using solar altitude/elevation and solar azimuth. The program will produce three graphs (Time vs. Solar Altitude, Time vs. Solar Azimuth, Solar Azimuth vs. Solar Altitude). As a right now, this is preliminary code meant to confirm if calculations and models are accurate. This program includes the calculations and visualization code necessary to display calculated values. The user can only input solar longitude and time frame (full day or half day); everything else is currently hard coded into the program. 

The matlab version of the code is meant to be used in conjuction with the Mars Irradiance repository. It takes the the time portion of one of the necessary datasets for calculating Mars Irradiance. Then, the program will use that dataset as the time values (instead of being hard coded like it is in the Python version). Besides this slight change, the code functions the same at the Python version.
