This is a program that tries to model Martian sun path. As a right now, this is preliminary code meant to confirm if calculations and models are accurate. This program includes the calculations and visualization code necessary to display calculated values. The user can only input solar longitude and time frame (full day or half day); everything else is currently ahrd coded into the program. Once we confirm that the calcualtions are accurate, more user options will be made avalible.
